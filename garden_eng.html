							<p>
								The creation of this software was motivated by the realization that as a text grows, it becomes longer to find precise parts of it.
								The project attempts to solve this problem.
							</p>
							<div>Non exhaustive list of functionalies presented in the above video:</div>
                            <ul>
								<li>Project management in a welcome menu.</li>
								<li>Text edition assisted by insertion buttons. Keyboard shortcuts can be used in their stead.</li>
								<li>File management inside a project.</li>
								<li>Temporal tags insertion and management in the text. The user can select a date and a label.
									When he clicks on a tag in the interface, the text cursor relocates itself where he was when the tag was created. Thanks to an in-house algorithm, the position
									of tags in the text tends to stay relevant no matter what modifications are made.
								</li>
								<li>Dark and light mode. This parameter, as well as others, is preserved from a session to another.</li>
                            </ul>
							<p>But there is still more.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/garden_demo2.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The application integrates an intuitive management of Git. It is possible to save the state of a project and navigate between each of its version with a few clicks.
								<br> Git branches are also supported. That way, if the user wants to modify an old version of his project, the application automaticaly creates a new branch.
								Each version of a project is sorted by time of creation and has a label.
							</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/garden_demo3.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								Finally, a priority for the project was to offer a simple interface. The user is free to choose the background for each visual mode (light and dark).
								He can also hide one or both of the side panels to minimize visual distractions. <br>
								On a side note the application is made to be used in fullscreen but my capture methods only allowed me to film it in windowed mode.
							</p>
							<p>The software was almost finished, but put in standby when I realized that the packaging of the app was failing on windows because of a conflict in the libraries.
								This allowed me to learn that before any actual progress is made in a project, all tools should be tested together for release on each supported platform.
								The project is not currently abandoned but it will come back in a different form.
