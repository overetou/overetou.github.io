							<h1 class="major">Lem-in</h1>
							<p>
								In this project you have to lead ants from a cavity A to a cavity B by taking the shortest path in an anthill. There are time constraints for the computation. To solve this
								problem, a breadth-first search (BFS) is a common solution. Project realized in duo.
							</p>
							<h1 class="major">Corewar</h1>
							<p>
								In Corewar you have to create a virtual machine in the form of an arena that executes asm code.
								The champions that fight inside it are asm code fragments. Theirs goal is to overwrite or to corrupt other champions.
								It is also asked to create a compiler of text asm code to binary code that can be interpreted by the arena.
								Project realized with a team of 4. As a bonus, we created a disassembler, wich is able to convert binary asm code back to text format.
							</p>
							<h1 class="major">Snowcrash</h1>
							<p>
								Snowcrash is an introduction to security. It takes the form of an OS image that you can launch in a virtual machine. The challenger has to obtain other users privileges by
								exploiting vulnerabilities and solving problems.
								Some of them are: public hash cracking, TCP streams analysis, cron tasks exploitation, code injection by different means (environement variables, backend function vulnerabilities, debugger, ...),
								race conditions and path modification.
							</p>
							<h1 class="major">Push-Swap</h1>
							<p>
								Optimisation centered project. You have two piles of number and a limited set of instructions to interchange the values stored in it.
								The goal is to output instructions that sort those numbers by value. Once you can correctly sort numbers, you are evaluated on the number
								of instructions taken to achieve the desired result.
								This is an introduction to sorting algorithms, especially the quicksort, and their adaptation in a slightly different context compared to where
								you usually find them.
							</p>
							<h1 class="major">Ongoing: Guimp</h1>
							<p>
								The goal is to create a user interface library from the lower level graphic library SDL2. You must then use it
								to reproduce an old version of <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>.
