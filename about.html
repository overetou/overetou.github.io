				<h3>Vision</h3>
				<p>Our vision is to create an assistant accessible to anyone and powerful enough to drastically accelerate digital
				work such as programming, interacting with systems or searching for information. Our approach is close to the metal.
				We want our users to be able to understand exactly what our system does and to modify it down to the finest details.
				That way control is preserved but speed, reliability and maintainability are improved.</p>
				<p>Our product is aimed at both consumers and companies, for direct use or for integration in systems and products.</p>
