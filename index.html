				<p class="product-name">DVT Overlay</p>
				<h2>Between traditionnal interfaces and AI</h2>
				<p>DVT Overlay is the fusion of a natural language arithmetic interpreter and an inference engine. All
				essential features of the program are implemented without any kind of machine learning.<br>
				From repetitive processes automation and assisted programmation to calendar management and simple day to day
				tasks, you can trust DVT Overlay on any system for a large panel of tasks.</p>
				<h2>Open source</h2>
				<p>DVT Overlay is opensource, free and without telemetry. It is exclusively developed by Darkvale
				Technologies.</p>
				<h2>Extendable</h2>
				<p>The capabilities of your instance are extendable with simple interactions or with third parties modules.</p>
				<h2>Online or offline</h2>
				<p>No internet connection is required. Enjoy the full capabilities of your assistant without worrying about
				your internet connection.</p>
				<h2>Clear intellectual property management</h2>
				<p>Know exactly what parts of your systems belong to who and under what conditions. The same applies to what is produced by your DVT Overlay instance.</p>
				<h2>Capitalize on your work</h2>
				<p>Did you significatively expand the abilities of your instance? Creating and exporting a module from it
				can be done in a few clicks. You may sell your modules or share them on our marketplace or any other compatible
				plateform. All of our standards are open.</p>
				<h2>Professionnal support</h2>
				<p>Need professionnal help around our product range ? We offer commercial support and bespoke contracts to help
				you get the most out of our software. Of course bugs or any other problem with our services can
				be reported for free. Thank you for your help and for your patronage.</p>
				<h2>Embedable</h2>
				<p>DVT Overlay is implemented in C and only requires a few megas to run. If there is a C compiler for your
				target plateform, you can run a DVT Overlay instance on it.</p>

				<h2>Darkvale Technologies creates a fast, interactive and reliable AI framework.</h2>
				<p>Our experimental technology pushes the boundaries of symbolic AI to provide an unmatched natural language interpreter
				capable of deep interactions with users. Running at full capacty on modest consummer hardware, our system makes usually long
				requests resolutions only last for milliseconds for a highly qualitative final result.</p>
				<p>The principle of this product is simple: it is a system that will execute any order given to it in english.</p>
				<p>While it is not yet suited for high level organic data processing, it is always correct on logical tasks and provides
				a high level of flexibility for commands interpretation. It can integrate with other APIs and operating systems.
				<h3>Interactivity</h3>
				<p>On each request, the system asks the user for any needed information not yet stored in its knowledge base. This interaction
				takes the form of a dialog or of simple choice if relevant. Each new element learned by the system is immediately
				available for use in any command that the user may give, with any modulation.</p>
				<h3>Reliability</h3>
				<p>The system does not rely on datasets to form itself. Data is stored and processed directly. Therefore licenses and ownership
				can be traced perfectly. Products developped with this system will not be vulnerable to copyright lawsuits.</p>
				<h3>Availability</h3>
				<p>Upon release the system will be made free and opensource. Revenues will be generated by accompanying services. Therefore
				users will be able to try, use and keep using our product for as long as they wish and equally be able to modify it themselves to suit their
				needs.</p>

				<h3>State of the project</h3>
				<p>A demonstration exists for the project but it is still in development. If you are interested, you may contact us at <b>darkvale-technologies@protonmail.com</b>.</p>
