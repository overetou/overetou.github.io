				<h2>Darkvale Technologies creates a fast, interactive and reliable AI framework.</h2>
				<p>Our experimental technology pushes the boundaries of symbolic AI to provide an unmatched natural language interpreter
				capable of deep interactions with users. Running at full capacty on modest consummer hardware, our system makes usually long
				requests resolutions only last for milliseconds for a highly qualitative final result.</p>
				<p>The principle of this product is simple: it is a system that will execute any order given to it in english.</p>
				<p>While it is not yet suited for high level organic data processing, it is always correct on logical tasks and provides
				a high level of flexibility for commands interpretation. It can integrate with other APIs and operating systems.
				<h3>Interactivity</h3>
				<p>On each request, the system asks the user for any needed information that is not yet in its knowledge base. This interaction
				takes the form of a dialog with open and closed questions. Each new element learned by the system is immediately
				available for use in any command that the user may give, with any modulation.</p>
				<h3>Reliability</h3>
				<p>The system does not rely on datasets to form itself. Data is stored and processed directly. Therefore licenses and ownership
				can be traced perfectly. Products developped with this system will not be vulnerable to copyright lawsuits.</p>
				<h3>Availability</h3>
				<p>Upon release the system will be made free and opensource. Revenues will be generated by accompanying services. Therefore
				users will be able to try, use and keep using our product for as long as they wish and equally be able to modify it themselves to suit their
				needs.</p>

				<h3>State of the project</h3>
				<p>A demonstration exists for the project but it is still in development. If you are interested, you may contact us at <b>darkvale-technologies@protonmail.com</b>.</p>
